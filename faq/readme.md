Welcome to the Wild West of Shapez.IO modding. There will be bugs, there will be struggles, but there will be fun new ways to play the game as well.

## Installing mods:
1. Back up any saves you care about. Often. Using mods has a possibility of corrupting a save.
![Step 1: Back up saves]()
2. Go to the [mod.io](https://shapez.mod.io) page and find a mod you want to play. Or you can do a couple, but don't go overboard. The more mods installed the more issues will pop up.
3. Open the `ZIP` file you just downloaded. There should be a `JS` file inside. Hang onto that.

4. Run the standalone game. Usually this will be through Steam.
5. Starting from the main menu, follow the purple buttons to the mod folder.

6. Drag the `JS` file from step 2 into the mod folder. It must be *directly inside* the folder, if it is in a deeper folder or still in the `ZIP` it will not be found.
![Step 5: Copy the mod file]()
7. Restart the game.
8. If you've done everything correctly, the mod should show up in the mods list.

## FAQ:
### I don't see the mod in the mod list!
Make sure you followed the instructions.
### I launched the game and it gave an error!
There's a mod that doesn't work. Find which mod doesn't appear in the mod list & remove it.
### The game crashed!
Do the same thing again, see if you can get it to crash the same way. Start removing mods and trying to make it crash again. Maybe a mod is incompatible with other mods you have installed?
### I have Shapez Industries and other mods installed and it's not working!
Shapez Industries is not intended to be played with other mods. Uninstall the others and try again.
### I can't load my save!
I told you to backup your saves... But you can also try [Save my Save](https://shapez.mod.io/save-my-save), it might fix something.
### I think I found a bug!
See if you can figure out what mod is causing it, let the developer for that mod know in #mod-feedback.
### Can I turn off a mod?
Not really, but you could just move it out of the `\mods` directory. I just have a `\mods\disabled` directory I use to move them out of the way.
